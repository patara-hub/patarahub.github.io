            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p class="posttext">
                Cuisine: Ethiopian <br>
                Address: 849 W University Dr., Tempe, AZ 85281<br>
                Website: <a target="_blank" href="https://cafelalibela.com/online-menu/">Cafe Lalibela</a><br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;Take a culinary adventure through eastern African, only a few minutes' drive away from ASU! While Ethiopian cuisine may not be the first option that comes to mind when finding a place to eat out, Cafe Lalibela's affordability, portion sizes, and delicious menu are sure to add it to your regular rotation.
            </p>
            <h3>My Recommendations</h3>
            <p class="posttext">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the menu items are stewed dishes made from various ingredients-- for vegetarians or vegans, there are a plethora of options ranging from lentils to carrots to collard greens, and meat lovers like myself have our pick from fish, lamb, chicken, and beef.<br>
                Though some dishes are listed as spicy, don't be afraid of them! Even people with a low spice tolerance (including me) can thoroughly enjoy the spicy dishes without any fear of capsaicin-flavored retribution. Actually, my go-to dish that I recommend is the Spicy Combination! Here are some of my other favorite dishes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chef's Favorite (comes with Doro Wat, Gomen, and Ayeb)</li>
                <li>Spicy Combination (comes with Doro Wat, Kye Sega Wat, and Misr Wat)</li>
                <li>Vegetable Combination (comes with Fasolia, Gomen, Misr Wat, and Tikil Gomen)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="posttext">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;All of the above come with Injera Bread and a salad (which has a very, very addicting peppercorn dressing). The combinations may seem pricey, being about $19 each, but these portions are big! I have easily eaten the leftovers for 4 or 5 meals afterwards, feeling full every time.
            </p>
            <p class="posttext">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Confused about the dishes' names? Have no fear! I've compiled some of my favorite dishes into a table for easy reference on what each of them are.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>English Equivalent</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Injera</td>
                    <td>Fermented Flatbread</td>
                    <td>A large, spongy flatbread that is eaten as an accompaniment to other dishes. The taste reminds me of sourdough bread in flavor, and pairs perfectly with the rich flavors of the stewed dishes!</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Key Sega Wat</td>
                    <td>Spicy Stewed Beef</td>
                    <td>One of the many delicious wat (stews) on the menu, this dish combines tender beef cubes with a spiced base with chili powder. A wonderful and warming dish, perfect with the slightly sour Injera bread! (For a less spiced version, try the Alicha Sega Wat!)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Fosolia</td>
                    <td>Spiced Green Beans</td>
                    <td>A hearty vegan- and vegetarian-friendly dish made from green beans, tomatoes, carrots, and onions. Bursting with flavor but not spicy, this dish is just as filling and fulfilling as any of the meat dishes!</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
